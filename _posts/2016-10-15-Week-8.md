title: Week 8 (10/9 - 10/15)
---

**This past week** was saw the release of OOP Project #3 and more concepts being taught.

**There isn't too much in my way.** I knocked out the allocator assignment Tuesday to focus on interview prep.

**Next week**, we'll submit Project #3, look more into vectors and STL containers, and data structure design, most likely.

Class

We received and discussed the Allocator assignment and dealt with the significance of now having access to heap memory and C++ allocators. 

Professor Downing did a good job of explaining the difference between stack-based and heap-based allocation methods, including pros/cons and how the STL allocator abstracts out the backing store. 

Allocator Assignment
--------------------
Professor Downing really did us a favor by giving us a well-defined and fairly straightforward assignment.
