This Really Isn't a Theory Class
--------------------------------
*A new school year dawns, which is the cue for every CS student to prepare for the enviable onslaught of programming assignments, weekly proof-based homeworks, and difficult exams.*

**This past week**, the first week of the semester, was spent reading syllabi, digitizing syllabi and readings into Nirvana, and installing things on my local Ubuntu dualboot where no one yells at me for typing 'sudo'. 
Luckily, Downing provides us a Docker image with everything on it for OOP. Unluckily, I replicated most of the structure locally. 

**There isn't much in my way**. While there's a part of me itching to get started on the OOP programming assignments, the rest of me realizes that they'll most likely be somewhat significant time investments. 
Setup's out of the way, since I can develop locally using Docker.  

**Next week** will involve absorbing more lecture material, preparing for the first assignment, and taking lots of quizzes.
The assigned papers look intriguing and not quite as daunting as "Knowledge and Common Knowledge in a Distributed Environment", the first paper we read for Distributed Computing. 
Seeing titles like "Git Guide" reinforces the theme that this class is a crash course in helping students acclimate to how things are done in industry.
