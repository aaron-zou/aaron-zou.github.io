This Really Isn't a Theory Class
--------------------------------
*A new school year dawns, which is the cue for every CS student to prepare for the unenviable onslaught of programming assignments, weekly proof-based homeworks, and difficult exams.*

**This past week**, the first week of the semester, was spent reading syllabi, digitizing syllabi and readings into Nirvana, and installing things on my local Ubuntu dualboot where no one yells at me for typing 'sudo'. 
Luckily, Downing provides us a Docker image with everything on it for OOP. Unluckily, I replicated most of the structure locally before I realized this. 

**There isn't much in my way**. While there's a part of me itching to get started on the OOP programming assignments, the rest of me realizes that they'll most likely be somewhat significant time investments. 
Setup's out of the way, since I can develop locally using Docker.  

**Next week** will involve absorbing more lecture material, preparing for the first assignment, and taking lots of quizzes.
The assigned readings look intriguing and nowhere as daunting as "Knowledge and Common Knowledge in a Distributed Environment", the first paper we read for Distributed Computing. 
Seeing titles like "Git Guide" reinforces the theme that this class is a crash course in helping students acclimate to how things are done in industry.

This class is very different from the courses I've taken thus far. Algorithms with Dr. Price and Distributed Computing with Dr. Alvisi heavily emphasized difficult but foundational theory. 
OOP is meant to help students learn about the software engineering process and useful industry tools like Docker, Google Test, and Travis CI.
This course also functions as an introduction to C++, the language that *with* smart pointers is still like a rifle with the safety half-on. 

Downing teaches by example, explaining assertions with code examples and output that clearly demonstrate their appropriate use cases, strengths, and weaknesses. 
He also quite literally picks people's names off the roster and calls them to answer questions about the code displayed on the screen.
From the two lectures we've had already, he's demonstrated good lecturing ability, a clear knowledge of the subject material, and an impressive streak of showing the class our collective first guess is often wrong.
