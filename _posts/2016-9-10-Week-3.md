title: Week 3 (9/4 - 9/10)
---

**This past week**, I worked on finishing up the Collatz project and attended Engineering Expo. As Professor Downing said, we should "move heaven and earth to not be here this coming summer and to get an internship instead". From my experience, internships have always been rewarding experiences. 

**What is in my way?** Not much is blocking me in OOP at the moment. I need to remember to stay up-to-date on the readings.

**Next week**, the second assignment will be released. I'll try to find a partner and apply the pair programming readings from last week to this assignment.

## Class Thoughts
This week was pretty interesting, to say the least. We spent Wednesday covering pre- and post-increment.This was accompanied by a healthy discussion of pass-by-value and pass-by-reference semantics. Downing reassured us that we didn't fully understand the topic, which was definitely proven correct when we got a collective ~33% on the quiz Friday. 

Pointers are often considered one of the hardest subjects for aspiring programmers to grasp. A single level of indirection takes a while to get used to. Then you get something like: 

```c
int *(*(*ptr)(int))[4]; // a pointer to a function with an int parameter that returns a pointer to an array of 4 pointers to ints 
```
