title: Week 4 (9/11 - 9/17)
---

**This past week** was both informative and frustrating. Having a UTCS alum talk to us about Bloomberg was a nice learning opportunity to get information both on Bloomberg as a company and what it's like to graduate and work in industry. However, the new assignment (Netflix) involved a lot of new logistical changes that added up to be somewhat frustrating.

**There isn't too much in my way.** Simon and I knocked out the design and separation of concerns and responsibilities pretty quickly in one pair programming session. We both understand clearly what's left to do to finish the assignment. Readings are important as usual.

**Next week**, the C(N)S career fair will be on everyone's minds. More than two hundred companies will be there, offering both internship and full-time opportunities. Netflix will also be due.
