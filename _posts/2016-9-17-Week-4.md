title: Week 4 (9/11 - 9/17)
---

**This past week** was both informative and frustrating. Having a UTCS alum talk to us about Bloomberg was a nice learning opportunity to get information both on Bloomberg as a company and what it's like to graduate and work in industry. However, the new assignment (Netflix) involved a lot of new logistical changes that added up to be somewhat frustrating.

**There isn't too much in my way.** Simon and I knocked out the design and separation of concerns and responsibilities pretty quickly in one pair programming session. We both understand clearly what's left to do to finish the assignment. Readings are important as usual.

**Next week**, the C(N)S career fair will be on everyone's minds. More than two hundred companies will be there, offering both internship and full-time opportunities. The fall fair is when most positions are open and more useful than the spring fair in my opinion. The Netflix assignment will also be due.

Course
------
This week, we went over the equal function, iterators, templates, and more passing arguments by value vs reference. Implementing equal on our own was a good exercise in understanding how to quickly generate the implementation for a public interface. I thought Downing did a good job covering templates, iterators, and trying to ensure that we really did understand passing by value vs reference. 


Netflix
-------
Downing decided to migrate to GitHub Classroom, champion the use of Boost, and introduce the use of caches sitting on the CS machines for us to use for the Netflix assignment. These are all great moves I have no issue with, but implementing them all at the same time might have been a little much to handle.

The migration to GitHub Classroom complicated Travis integration and required a few Piazza posts and someone contacting Travis CI support before the remainder went smoothly. The rationale was to avoid needing to invite the graders to everyone's repos while also providing sandboxing of each team's repos. While all's well that ends well, doing a trial run beforehand might have been helpful in understanding what steps were necessary to get everything up and running. 

Boost has a nice serialization library, as Professor Downing pointed out to us. Reading through tutorials and documentation revealed the code itself to be pretty straightforward to use.

Tip of the Week
---------------
Contrary to what our nice guest speaker said, Vim is clearly superior to Emacs.
