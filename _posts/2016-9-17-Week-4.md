title: Week 4 (9/11 - 9/17)
---

**This past week** was both informative and frustrating. Having a UTCS alum talk to us about Bloomberg was a nice learning opportunity to get information both on Bloomberg as a company and what it's like to graduate and work in industry. However, the new assignment (Netflix) involved a lot of new logistical changes that added up to be somewhat frustrating.

**There isn't too much in my way.** Simon and I knocked out the design and separation of concerns and responsibilities pretty quickly in one pair programming session. We both understand clearly what's left to do to finish the assignment. Readings are important as usual.

**Next week**, the C(N)S career fair will be on everyone's minds. More than two hundred companies will be there, offering both internship and full-time opportunities. The fall fair is when most positions are open and more useful than the spring fair in my opinion. The Netflix assignment will also be due.

Course
------
This week, we went over the equal function, iterators, templates, and more passing arguments by value vs reference. Implementing equal on our own was a good exercise in understanding how to quickly generate the implementation for a public interface. I thought Downing did a good job covering templates, iterators, and trying to ensure that we really did understand passing by value vs reference.

Tip of the Week
---------------
Contrary to what our nice guest speaker said, Vim is clearly superior to Emacs.
