title: Week 5 (9/18 - 9/25)
---

**This past week** was very busy. FoCS and the CNS career fair came and went. We had a representative from JPL speak to our class. The Netflix assignment deadline also came and went.

**There isn't too much in my way.** Until Project 3 hits, OOP will consist mainly of continuing our discussion of iterators,
algorithms, and their implementations in the STL.

**Next week**, the OOP Test #1 continues its inexorable march. More readings will present themselves, and class will continue.

Netflix

Downing decided to migrate to GitHub Classroom, champion the use of Boost, and introduce the use of caches sitting on the CS machines for us to use for the Netflix assignment. These are all great moves I have no issue with, but implementing them all at the same time might have been a little much to handle.

The migration to GitHub Classroom complicated Travis integration and required a few Piazza posts and someone contacting Travis CI support before the remainder went smoothly. The rationale was to avoid needing to invite the graders to everyone's repos while also providing sandboxing of each team's repos. While all's well that ends well, doing a trial run beforehand might have been helpful in understanding what steps were necessary to get everything up and running. 

Boost has a nice serialization library, as Professor Downing pointed out to us. Reading through tutorials and documentation revealed the code itself to be theoretically straightfoward to use. However, it took me the better part of the morning to set up some tests using serialization functions and modify the makefile and .travis.yml. Getting the code to actually compile took an hour or so of wandering through the internet trying to figure out exactly what was necessary. While it turns out that an additional package is necessary as well as a LDFLAG being passed in to g++, this effort could have been saved upfront with instructions.

Not being allowed to use multiple files bothers me even though I'm pretty sure why the limitation was imposed. Allowing students to use new/malloc/delete/free is more likely than not to cause issues due to poor memory management. Similarly, allowing multiple files doesn't allow for a Makefile file check target and would force the graders to use a provided Makefile that may or may not actually work. For medium to larger projects, however, the implementation is never all in one file.

In the real world, things aren't nice and cut and dry. Installation instructions turn out not to work, a co-worker's code works on their machine only, specs and deadlines change. While I was somewhat frustrated I needed to spend significant time figuring things out, I still found the Netflix assignment to be meaningful and an interesting problem.
