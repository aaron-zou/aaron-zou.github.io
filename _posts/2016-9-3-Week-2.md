title: Week 2 (8/29 - 9/4)
---

**This past week** we received our first assignment, Collatz, discussed various aspects during class, and also explored exceptions. I worked on Collatz, familiarizing myself with the workflow prescribed in the spec, and finished after about two days of work. My time estimate was roughly half the amount of time I actually spent - I was reminded of Dr. Downing's assurance that our estimates would suck but get better over time (hopefully). 

**What is in my way**

**Next week**
